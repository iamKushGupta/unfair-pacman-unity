# Unfair Pac-man

> Theme: "Roots of Gaming"
>> You can't disagree with this.

> We made the game unfair by randomly teleporting the ghosts across the grid at any given time.

> Another unfair gameplay we added was with the "Power Pellets". The Power Pellets which otherwise give you the ability to kill the ghosts, they can now also kill you. A random probablity though ;)

> When you kill a ghost, it would also get teleport to any location on the grid. Even on non-accessable zones.

>> Built on Unity and C#
